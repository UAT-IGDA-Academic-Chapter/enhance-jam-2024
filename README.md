# Enhance Jam - 2024
### What is it?
The Enhance Jam is a reoccurring game jam hosted by The IGDA student chapter of the University of Advancing Technology.
Generally, participants break up into teams and create a single (hopefully) self-contained feature for the game in 48 hours.
Afterwards judges and participants vote on which submissions will be merged into the main branch.
The features become merged and the result will become the base project for the next Enhance Jam.

### Theme
## General Guidelines
- Adhere to the [UAT Code of Conduct](https://www.uat.edu/uat-policies)
- Be respectful of your fellow jammers
  
### Version Control
Programmers, artists, etc. are expected to use Git to upload assets into the project themselves.  If anyone does not understand how to use Git, ask around in the Discord.  [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is a great GUI Git Client that also shows merge differences between 2D art files visually, and generally has a very user-friendly UI for anyone.

**Branching** - 
- All newly created branches should be branched off of `develop`.
- Branch names for features should be formatted as `feature/<feature-name>`.
- Branch names for art assets should be formatted as `art/<asset-collection-name>`.

### Programming Style Guide
If using **GDScript** -
- Simply follow the official [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

If using **C#** -
- Follow the official [Godot C# style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_style_guide.html).
- Use '_' to prefix pascalCased private variables.

Please do not add any dependencies that cannot be included in the version control.

_**Remember**_ - The board will be conducting a code review process.  Pull requests may be REJECTED, ACCEPTED, or ACCEPTED WITH CHANGES.  If ACCEPTED WITH CHANGES, a PR may be rewritten to adhere to the requests in the review and be merged.  Any changes asked for will be the board's best understanding of public opinion based on voting discussions, as well as adherence to the style guides laid out here.
